# Virtual Human Models for Metax GPU Platform

![logo](./imgs/logo.png)
## Introduction

Currently, virtual humans are widely used in various industries, and the purpose of this project is to help developers quickly migrate virtual human projects based on other GPU platforms to the MetaX GPU platform.

## Available Projects
### 1. [LiteAvatar for Metax GPU platform](./LiteAvatarForMetaX/README.md)
- **[LiteAvatar](https://github.com/HumanAIGC/lite-avatar.git)** is a audio2face model for realtime 2D chat avatar, which can run in 30fps on only CPU devices without GPU acceleration.

### 2. [MuseTalk for Metax GPU Platform](./MuseTalkForMetaX/README.md) 
- **[MuseTalk](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MuseTalk.git)** is a real-time high quality lip-syncing model, wich can be applied with input videos as a complete virtual human solution.

### 3. [MusePose for Metax GPU Platform](./MusePoseForMetaX/README.md) 
- **[MusePose](https://github.com/TMElyralab/MusePose.git)** is an image-to-video generation framework for virtual human under control signal such as pose.

### 4. [CosyVoice for Metax GPU Platform](./CosyVoiceForMetaX/README.md)
- **[CosyVoice](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice.git)** is a powerful voice generation model, which supports multiple languages, with fast and stable generation.

### 5. [OpenAvatarChat for Metax GPU Platform](./OpenAvatarChatForMetaX/README.md)
- **[OpenAvatarChat](https://github.com/HumanAIGC-Engineering/OpenAvatarChat.git)** is a modular interactive virtual human dialogue implementation that can run full functionality on a single PC. Currently, it supports MiniCPM-o as a multimodal language model or can use cloud APIs to replace the standard ASR + LLM + TTS implementation.
